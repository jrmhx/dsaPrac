## CMakeLists.txt Example

```cmake
# Set the minimum required version of CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Project definition: project name and supported languages
project(MyProject VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

# Specify the C++ standard (e.g., C++17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

# Include directories where to find header files
# If you have any headers in the include/ directory, use this
include_directories(include)

# Add the executable and specify the source files
add_executable(my_program
  src/main.cpp
  src/abc.cpp
)

# Add an external library
# Assume xyz is a system-installed library or available in the external directory

# Option 1: If xyz is installed in the system (e.g., using a package manager like apt or brew)
find_package(XYZ REQUIRED) # This uses CMake's package discovery system

# Option 2: If xyz is a local library (e.g., located in the external/xyz directory)
# If you need to link to a local library (from source or compiled binaries), do something like:
add_subdirectory(external/xyz)

# Link the external xyz library to your executable
target_link_libraries(my_program xyz)  # 'xyz' can be a library target name defined in XYZ CMake

# Alternatively, if linking with system-installed libraries manually, use:
# target_link_libraries(my_program /path/to/libxyz.so)
```

## Building the Project

```bash
# Create a build directory and navigate to it
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure the project
cmake ..
```

## Using g++ in Command Line

```bash
# Compile the project using g++
g++ -std=c++17 src/main.cpp src/abc.cpp -o my_program
```
